# QuadraticFormulaSolver
This program solves quadratic equations. First the user enters the values a, b and c. Then, the program will tell them wether the formula has 2, 1 or no solutions. It will then display the solution. Something new I learnt while making this program was the cmath libary. This allowed me to add a square root function the same way the quadratic formula uses it.
